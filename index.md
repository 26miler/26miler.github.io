## Welcome to 26Miler

- ðŸ‘‹ I can get your strava activities just by using voice, e.g. 'Alexa ask 26miler to check my last activity'
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more skills to read different stats using strava api

### Voice command list
```markdown
- Alexa open 26miler
- Alexa ask 26miler to check my last activity
