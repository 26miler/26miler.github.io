## Welcome to 26Miler

- ðŸ‘‹ I can get your strava activities just by using voice, e.g. 'Alexa ask 26miler to check my last activity'
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more skills to read different stats using strava api

### Steps to Activate 26Miler Skill
- Search skills and games on your Alexa App (must be pre-installed on your phone) with keywords, 26 miler or strava. From search results, pick 'Twenty Six Miler' and enable the skill
- Once enabled, you must complete the account linking. For that, tap 'settings button' --> tap 'link' --> sign in using your strava account credentials (refer to screenshot below)
