## Welcome to 26Miler

- ðŸ‘‹ With my friend Alexa, I can get your strava activities just by using voice, e.g. 'Alexa ask 26miler to check my last activity'
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more skills to read different stats using strava api

### Voice command list
```markdown
- Alexa open 26miler
- Alexa ask 26miler to check my last activity
- Alexa ask 26miler to check this week's run distance
- Alexa ask 26miler to check last week's run distance

# More commands would be added in future
```
